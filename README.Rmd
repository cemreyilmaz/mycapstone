The goal of mycapstone is to analyze the earthquake data that were collected and 
archived by NOAA and that can be found at

```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to clean your data:

data <- utils::read.delim("earthquakes.tsv")
data <- eq_clean_data(data)
data <- eq_location_clean(data)
```
